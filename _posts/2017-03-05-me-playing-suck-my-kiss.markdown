This is me playing `Suck my Kiss` by the `Red Hot Chili Peppers`.
I learned the rhythm part from [Justin Sandercoe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCJwzwrK8tk){:target="_blank"} and the solo from [Marty Schwartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFvGt0EpggI){:target="_blank"}.

The backing track is from [guitarbackingtracks.com](https://www.guitarbackingtrack.com/play/red_hot_chili_peppers/suck_my_kiss_(2).htm){:target="_blank"}
